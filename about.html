            I am Benjamin Le. That probably doesn't give a lot of information,
            so let me introduce myself.
            <br /><br />
            I am an undergraduate student, looking to complete my Bachelor's of
            Science in Computer Science. My aim is to be completed by Spring of
            2024.
            <br /><br />
            I work primarily work in C and C++ for my schoolwork, so those are
            the languages I am most familiar with. However, I have begun to work
            on more personal projects, and with those I have been trying to
            teach myself Python and Java.
            <br /><br />
            In my free time, I enjoy cracking open a new book whether it be
            fictional or non-fictional. I also enjoy fashion, so I'll find
            myself browsing the latest runway shows as well as deep Ebay
            searches to find hidden gems.
